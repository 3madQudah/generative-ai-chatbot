# 🤖 Generative AI Chatbot – From Scratch to Transformers

An **end-to-end Generative AI & NLP project** that builds a chatbot pipeline starting from raw conversational data and progressing through **statistical language models, RNN-based Seq2Seq architectures, and Transformer models**, ending with a fully interactive chatbot application.

This project is designed to demonstrate **deep understanding of NLP foundations and modern Large Language Model (LLM) architectures**, implemented using **PyTorch**.

---

## 📌 Project Motivation

Large Language Models (LLMs) power modern AI applications such as chatbots, assistants, and text generation systems.  
This project was built to **understand how these systems work internally**, rather than using them as black boxes.

The focus is on:
- Building models **from scratch**
- Understanding architectural trade-offs
- Applying modern NLP pipelines in practice
